### Goal

The 1000 Brains Challenge participants will have to predict the age of healthy individuals based on structural Magnetic Resonance images of their brains.

_Bonus_

Among the healthy subjects there is subset of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, but these are not labeled. The bonus goal consists in identifying those subjects with Alzheimer's Disease in the database in an unsupervised manner.

### Resources

- **Database**: 1000 healthy individuals with T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance images.

- **Volumetric and Morphometric analyses**: all the T1-weighted images have been processed with a standard volumetric and morphometric analysis tool available in the QMENTA platform.

- **Getting started material**: this GitHub repository contains introductory Jupyter notebooks to get started with the QMENTA Python client, training a simple regression model and packaging your predictive model in a Docker image with our Software Development Kit (SDK).

### Preparing the Python environment

The Jupyter notebooks in this repository have been writtend and tested with **Python 3.6**. 

**Python 2.7** support is not guaranteed.

At QMENTA we extensively use the Python Conda distribution, as its `conda` utilities allow you to easily manage and install the needed scientific computing environments.
